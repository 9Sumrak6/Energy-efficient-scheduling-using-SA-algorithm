Implementation of Energy-efficient scheduling using SA algorithm in C++.

Input and output format are given in format.pdf.

Although multiple examples of input and results are given in directories 'Input' and 'Output' respectively.

To compile .cpp files you can run Makefile, that will generate 'inp_gen' and 'main' executables.
